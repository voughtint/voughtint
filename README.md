c+h is more than welcome, int is cool as well but i'm not talkative ;-; sorry! i don't interact first either ;-;
don't copy my skins and ***ask*** before you take inspo for anything of mine. like i said, i'm not that talkative
at all, very low energy and i have severe trust issues, if i don't get a good read on you then i probably wont
really interact with you but i try to be friendly/welcoming regardless. i have **professionally diagnosed**
avpd, mdd, audhd, &&. other unlisted. fluctuating empathy and dry responses. blah blah blah, i'll write
more later. idk.

***currently struggling with my mental health, won't be that energetic or anything really.***

i like the boys, star wars, x-men, creepypasta, the owl house, persona 5, lis, arcane, and rdr2. plus other stuff
that i dont care to name. basic dni, i block and hide freely. discord is voughtinc if you ever need to reach out and im not on pt, i rarely
use it so replies will be slow.
